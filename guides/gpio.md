The Raspberry Pi has 54 GPIO pins (pins 0 to 53) that can be used to interact with external sensors and devices.
GPIO pins are peripherals, and they are controlled via special memory locations called **peripheral registers.** Keep in mind that peripheral 
registers are not the same as the other registers we learned about (r0–r15).

To control the GPIO pins, we use the four gpio peripheral registers: `FSEL`,  `SET`, `CLR`, and `LEV`. The table below shows
the memory addresses of these registers. (Some of the addresses are labeled "Reserved", which means we don't want to mess with them.)

![Table of GPIO registers and their addresses, field names, which pins they address, and whether they are read or write access.
The FSEL addresses (FSEL 0 through FSEL 5) start at 0x20200000 and end at 0x20200014. Each FSEL register covers 10 GPIO pins, so
FSEL 0 maps to gpio pins 0 through 9, FSEL 1 maps to gpio pins 10-19, etc. We have read and write access to the FSEL registers.
Between FSEL and SET registers, the address 0x20200018 is reserved. The SET registers are 0x2020001C (pins 0-31) and 0x20200020
(pins 32-53). The SET registers only have write access. The two CLR registers are the same, at 0x20200028 and 0x2020002C.
The two LEV registers are the same as SET and CLR but they are read-only. They are at 0x20200034 and 0x20200038.](../images/gpio-registers.png){: .w-75 .mx-auto}

<small>I adapted this table from the [Broadcom BCM2835 ARM Peripherals datasheet, p.90](/readings/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf#page=90)!</small>

Notice that there are six `FSEL` registers but only 2 each of `SET`, `CLR`, and `LEV`.  Why is this?  Each `FSEL` register is listed as controlling 10 GPIO pins, such as `FSEL0` for pins 0-9. The `SET0` register covers 32 pins, from 0 to 31. The `SET`, `CLR`, and `LEV` registers deal with pins being on or off, a state which can be represented with a single bit per pin. In contrast, a `FSEL` register is used to set the function
of a pin, of which there are eight possible settings (input, output, ALT0-ALT5). To distinguish eight different possibilites requires three bits, so we can fit at most 10 pins (= 30 bits) into a 32-bit `FSEL` register (with 2 bits left over). Thus to control all 54 GPIO pins requires six `FSEL` registers and 2 each of `SET`/`CLR`/`LEV`.

## Configure a pin:`FSEL`
The `FSEL` registers are used to set the function of a GPIO pin. The eight different pin functions are __Input__, __Output__, and six __Alternate__ functions 0-5. Each function is represented as three bits. For example, the __Input__ function is `000` and __Output__ function is `001`.

The __Output__ function configures a pin to be used as an output. We can change the value of an output pin using `SET` and `CLR`. This lets us turn on LEDs, for example.

The __Input__ function configures a pin to be used as an input. We can read the value of the pin using `LEV`. This lets us determine whether a button has been pressed, for example.

To set GPIO pin 3 as an output, for instance, we would set bits 6-8 (highlighted below) to `001` in the `FSEL0` register.

## Turn on a pin: `SET`

The `SET` registers are used to **turn on** a GPIO output pin. (We cannot turn off a GPIO output pin with `SET`, instead see `CLR` below).

For example, if we wanted to turn on GPIO pin 26, we could write the value `0b00000100000000000000000000000000` into the `SET0` register. That will turn on pin 26.

`SET` registers are **write-only**. You write to the register to turn a pin on, but it is not possible to read from the reigster to get the current state. (Technically, it will let you read the `SET` register, but you can't trust that the values will be accurate. Instead see `LEV` below.)

## Turn off a pin: `CLR`

The `CLR` registers are used to **turn off** a GPIO output pin. Writing a `1` to a specific bit in the `CLR` register will turn off
the pin. It is not intuitive—you would assume that you write a `1` to turn something on, and a `0` to turn something off!  to turn off (`CLR`) is separate from the mechansim to turn on (`SET`). In both cases, we write a `1`, and whether this causes the pin to turn on or off is determined by whether we are writing the `1` into the `SET` register or the `CLR` register.

Writing `0b00000100000000000000000000000000` into the `CLR0` register would turn off GPIO pin 26. This is the same value used to turn on pin 26, but we write the value to a different address (`0x20200028`, `CLR0`, instead of `0x2020001C`, `SET0`).

Like `SET`, `CLR` registers are **write-only**. Reading from the `CLR` register cannot be used to reliably read the current state.

## Read a pin: `LEV`

The `LEV` registers are used to read the on-off value of a GPIO pin.  The `LEV` value can be read for any pins, whether it is an input or an output pin. It makes most sense to read the
`LEV` of an input pin, because we haven't set that value ourselves (it's from an outside source). `LEV` registers are laid out like `SET` and `CLR` registers (32 bits,
representing 32 pins). If the bit value is `1`, the corresponding gpio is on, and if `0`, it is off.

`LEV` registers are **read-only**. We can't write to a `LEV` register to turn on or off a pin (use `SET`
or `CLR` instead).
